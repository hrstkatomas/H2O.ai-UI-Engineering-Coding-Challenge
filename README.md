My take on H2O.ai UI Engineering Coding Challenge

### NPM scripts
run `$ npm run dev` to run development environment

run `$ npm run build` to build the solution, output will be waiting ing public folder, so go ahead and give that index.html a double click

run `$ npm run test` to run the tests of the app

# [Assinment](/Assignment.pdf) with clarifications 

Tests - brief is fine, i.e. doesn't need to be exhaustive. Just one or two tests that demonstrate your preferred approach to testing is just fine. 

Scroll bar - no need to replicate; default is fine.
